# Herbal Medicine PubMed Evidence Extraction

This repository contains structured evidence summaries for multiple herbal medicines based on peer-reviewed studies indexed in PubMed. For each herb, I searched PubMed, screened human clinical studies (trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses), and extracted standardized information on efficacy and safety into JSON format. These summaries will be used to build a scientific poster and a written report.





# Project Overview

For each herb I:

- Searched PubMed using common and botanical names  
- Applied filters for human, clinical, and higher-quality study designs  
- Extracted key fields: study design, population, main findings, and safety profile  
- Wrote short, plain-language result summaries plus MLA citations and PubMed links  

The goal is to create comparable evidence base across herbs rather than relying on anecdotes or single studies.








# Planned Report & Poster Sections

The final report and poster will be organized into the following sections:

- **Introduction** – Why are herbal medicines widely used, and why evidence review needed?  
- **Background for Each Herb** – Traditional uses, typical preparations, and key active compounds.  
- **Mechanisms of Action** – Proposed biological pathways (anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, etc.) based on the literature.  
- **Clinical Evidence Summary** – What the extracted studies show about efficacy across conditions and populations, with attention to study quality.  
- **Safety & Adverse Effects** – Common side effects, serious risks, and gaps in long-term safety data.  
- **Overall Assessment & Limitations** – Strength of evidence for each herb, major uncertainties, and limitations of this literature review.









# Skills Demonstrated

- Systematic PubMed searching and study screening  
- Evidence extraction and concise summarization  
- Structuring biomedical information in JSON  
- Critical appraisal of efficacy and safety for herbal therapies
