    "results_summary": "This randomized single-blind comparative trial evaluated tea tree oil 5% versus benzoyl peroxide 5% in patients with mild to moderate acne. Results showed that both treatments reduced acne lesions, with tea tree oil showing fewer side effects but slower onset; mostly minor adverse events reported. Effects were generally modest and safety signals were acceptable, but larger and longer trials are recommended.",
